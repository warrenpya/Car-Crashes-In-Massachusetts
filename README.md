![map of massachusetts car crashes in 2021](/final.png)
#Project Description
This poster shows all car crashes that happened in 2021 in Massachusetts. Each dot represents a crash, and the color of the dot represents the severity of the crash.
I used Python to visualize the data on the poster from a dataset, and I used Gimp to edit the image.

#Project Purpose
I created this poster so that I could practice Python, as well as to create something that I'm proud of and can show to other people. I originally planned only
to create the map of crashes with no text. But, I wanted anyone looking at this poster to take something away from it. So, I wrote a message about
the danger and consequences of cars and the right direction to move in. The idea of transitioning faster to alternative and safer modes of transportation was 
the original motivation behind looking at car crash data, so I wanted this poster to send that message.
